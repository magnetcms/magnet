2. **Create a branch**: Use a descriptive branch name
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```
3. **Make your changes**: Follow the coding standards below
4. **Test your changes**: Ensure all tests pass
5. **Commit your changes**: Follow the commit message conventions
6. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin your-branch-name`

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** 1.2.2+ (recommended) or Node.js 18+
- **MongoDB** 6.0+ (for running examples and tests)
- Git

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/magnet.git
cd magnet

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development
bun run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run specific test suite
cd apps/e2e
bun run test
```

### Building Packages

```bash
# Build all packages
bun run build

# Build specific package
cd packages/core
bun run build
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **No `any` types**: Always use proper TypeScript types
- **Strict typing**: Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- **Interfaces over types**: Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- **Use type guards**: Implement proper type narrowing

### Code Style

- **Formatter**: Biome is used for formatting (automatically applied)
- **Linting**: Run `bun run lint` before committing
- **Naming conventions**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and types
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

### Code Organization

- **Keep functions small**: Single responsibility principle
- **Use meaningful names**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Add comments**: Explain "why" not "what"
- **JSDoc comments**: Document all public APIs, decorators, and types

### Example Code Structure

```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of the function
 * @param param1 Description of param1
 * @param param2 Description of param2
 * @returns Description of return value
 */
export function exampleFunction(param1: string, param2: number): boolean {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 strategy support

fix(core): resolve schema validation issue

docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

```

### Package Guidelines

- Each package should have its own `package.json` with proper metadata
- Use workspace protocol for internal dependencies: `"@magnet/core": "workspace:*"`
- Export types and interfaces from `index.ts`
- Include proper TypeScript declarations

## Testing Guidelines

- **Write tests**: New features should include tests
- **Update tests**: Fix tests when modifying existing features
- **Test coverage**: Aim for good test coverage
- **E2E tests**: Add E2E tests for user-facing features in `apps/e2e`

### Running Linters and Type Checkers

```bash
# Lint all packages
bun run lint

# Type check all packages
bun run check-types
```

## Working on Roadmap Features

We maintain a [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/magnet-cms/projects/3) that tracks planned features across four development phases. Contributing to roadmap items is a great way to make a significant impact on the project.

### Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Milestone | Focus Area |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Phase 1 | v1.0 - Security & Access | RBAC, User Management, API Keys, Audit Logging |
| Phase 2 | v1.1 - Integration & Automation | Webhooks, Scheduling, Event Hooks |
| Phase 3 | v1.2 - Developer Experience | GraphQL, Search, Preview Mode |
| Phase 4 | v1.3 - Team Collaboration | Workflows, Comments, Bulk Operations |

### How to Pick Up a Roadmap Issue

1. **Browse the roadmap**: Visit the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/magnet-cms/projects/3) to see available issues
2. **Check issue labels**:
   - `priority: critical` - Highest priority, needed ASAP
   - `priority: high` - Important for the next release
   - `priority: medium` - Should be done soon
   - `priority: low` - Nice to have
3. **Comment on the issue**: Let maintainers know you'd like to work on it
4. **Wait for assignment**: A maintainer will assign the issue to you
5. **Create a branch**: Use the format `feat/issue-number-short-description`
6. **Follow the acceptance criteria**: Each issue includes detailed requirements

### Issue Labels Reference

**Phase Labels:**
- `phase: 1-security` - Security & Access features
- `phase: 2-integration` - Integration & Automation features
- `phase: 3-dx` - Developer Experience features
- `phase: 4-collaboration` - Team Collaboration features

**Area Labels:**
- `area: core` - Core package changes
- `area: admin` - Admin UI changes
- `area: api` - API endpoint changes
- `area: auth` - Authentication/Authorization changes

**Type Labels:**
- `type: feature` - New feature implementation
- `type: infrastructure` - Architecture/infrastructure work
- `type: plugin` - Plugin development

### Tips for Roadmap Contributions

- **Start with smaller issues**: If you're new to the project, pick up a `priority: medium` or `priority: low` issue first
- **Read related code**: Understand existing patterns before implementing new features
- **Follow the checklist**: Each issue has acceptance criteria - make sure to complete all items
- **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, comment on the issue before starting work
- **Keep PRs focused**: If an issue is large, discuss breaking it into smaller PRs

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **JSDoc comments**: Add to all exported functions, classes, and interfaces
- **Type documentation**: Document complex types and interfaces
- **Example usage**: Include code examples in JSDoc when helpful

### User Documentation

- **MDX files**: Update documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/en/`
- **Readme updates**: Update relevant README files if needed
- **Examples**: Add examples to example apps when applicable

### Documentation Format

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new schema instance with the provided options.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * @Schema({ timestamps: true })
 * export class User {
 *   @Prop()
 *   name: string;
 * }
 * ```
 */
```

## Pull Request Process
